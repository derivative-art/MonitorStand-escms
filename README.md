# MonitorStand-escms

> This repo heavily relies on Majenko Technologies' `"AdvancedWebServer"`, example code for the `esp8266`.
> Big thanks to all you fine people in the opensource universe.


In accordance with the class requirements for [ROB 498/599: Storytelling with Robotics](https://storytelling.robotics.umich.edu/schedule) this code is meant to be deployed with the [eye-strain-conscious-monitor-stand](https://derivative-art.github.io/invest_in_futility/eye-strain-conscious-monitor-stand) _if it works my mom would have been proud, at least I can do something, even if it is useless_.



 
## The web service
The web service is really only used to help debug the sensors.  Maybe I will add a feature to use this in the project, but I have to first get the monitor moving, don't I!?



# Future (get parts then code)
1.  [ ] Acquire a movement sensor
1.  [ ] Acquire a motor driver chip
1.  [ ] Acquire a motor strong enough to move a monitor stand.
1.  [ ] Acquire a power-supply that has a USB output...
